_especially for the following topics_:
- rewriting the full setup-scalingo action in TS (instead of a composite "shell" Action, inspired from [hashicorp/setup-terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)), this will enable automatic caching thanks to `@actions/tool-cache`
- full-compatibility with Windows runners
- action to run commands in one-off containers
- action to create database backup
- action to create review app (with optional database copy !)
